The Cryptocurrency Trading Simulation Game
======

This is an online web application developed for my course CS307 at Purdue University with a team of 6 in Agile development of a Stock-market based Cryptocurrency online simulation that allows users to practice trading stocks in a risk-free sandbox type environment. The project uses a client-server model. A number of clients connect to the server requesting data such as game/user information. The server then sends a request to the database, which responds with the information. A separate worker component in the server continuously works to keep pricing information of the stocks accurate.

Client:
- Frontend of the project
- Serves as the interface for the game
- Requests information from the server
- Receives information back from the server and modifies the game screen

Server:
- Backend of the project
- Does most of the processing work for the client and API
- Updates database with cryptocurrency market information continuously

Database:
- Stores user and game information received by server
- Sends requested information to the server to handle
- Data is stored securely with user authentication features implemented.

Stock API:
- Third party API that provides information on pricing for various stocks and historical data - Polled by the server at a regular interval to keep prices up-to-date.

Architecture:
- Frontend is developed with ReactJS and the server in Python with Flask - User and stock data is stored in PostgreSQL database, using Docker.

- Web application is deployed through Amazon Web Services.
Our project features real-time data of stock pricing which is done by polling the API for information that is used real-time. We also use historical data as a feature.


To run the frontend, read client-react/README.md
If `npm run` in the client-react directory fails, try `npm install` in the client-react directory.
If npm doesn't work in general, you may not have Node installed.
    Youâ€™ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine


Docker
======
If you wanna use docker for an oh-so-clean, system-dependency-free, and
effortless testing setup, run `docker-compose -f dev-docker-compose.yml up` to
spin up a local db, api, and client.  Whenever you add a dependency to
package.json or requirements.txt, you should rebuild: `docker-compose -f
dev-docker-compose.yml build`.

You can run client tests with `docker-compose -f testing-docker-compose.yml run
client`

And api tests with `docker-compose -f testing-docker-compose.yml run api`

Debugging with docker
---------------------
You can debug JS on the browser. If you wanna debug Python, `docker attach
<container id>`. When you hit a `breakpoint()` it'll drop you into pdb.
