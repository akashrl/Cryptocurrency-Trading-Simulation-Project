To run the frontend, read client-react/README.md
If `npm run` in the client-react directory fails, try `npm install` in the client-react directory.
If npm doesn't work in general, you may not have Node installed.
    Youâ€™ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine

If you wanna use docker, `docker-compose -f dev-docker-compose.yml up`.
Whenever you add a dependency, you should `docker-compose -f dev-docker-compose
build`
